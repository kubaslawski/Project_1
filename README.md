The app has been created to make a way for the users to get rid of the stuff they don’t use, or just to help some charities. The user can even create his/her organization. 
On the home page is a list with some foundations, organization, etc. so the user can have a look to see what organizations are on the list. Every organization has a mission and its needs. Thus, the user first needs to choose what stuff want to give, and then the list of proper institutions which can get the donation. User can check his profile, there is a list of organizations that he/she supported, etc. If the user has a foundation, there will be a list of all donations, the top users who donated, etc. 
There is also a mailbox where the user gets the notification, as well as can write private messages between users.
Application is hosted on: 
https://charityfoundationsapp.herokuapp.com/

Used techs:
-Python (Django)
-JS, HTML, CSS
-PostgreSQL as a database.

To do list:
-Make mailbox more interactive
-Error alerts while sending data to the server (now, if the data is not correct wouldn’t be any alert about it, nothing happens)
